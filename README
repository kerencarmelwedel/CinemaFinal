Cinema application - ordering movie tickets 
This is the final project i made for my .Net certified Programmer course, at the Technion. 
Its a ticket ordering program for an imaginary cinema, for my favorite movies (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Back to the future...).
Shows some c# and Java Script skills together with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and MVC. 
Loved making it! its not perfect though, i might add some changes soon.
